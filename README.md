With over a decade of experience as a skilled psychology professor and researcher, I have primarily focused on the consequences of institutional maltreatment on children's physical and psychological development.

My extensive background in research methodology, data analysis, and statistics has enabled a plethora of published research projects.

My interdisciplinary research approach, spanning child development, abuse and neglect, institutionalization, child and mother health, public health, social work, psychopathology, and personality, showcases a rich and diverse expertise dedicated to addressing crucial societal and psychological challenges.
